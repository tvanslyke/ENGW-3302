## Format
The format used for this manual, namely using Markdown as the genre for the manual, was intended to reflect the common practice of modern open-source software projects using a lightweight markup language for their README files.  Additionally, because github is popular software project hosting platform with a built-in markdown display engine, it made sense to host the project on github.

## Structure
The manual holds off on discussing specific genres at first, instead opting to address the way that FOSS programmers, hackers, write and speak.  It is important to understand these conventions before diving in to the genres, I think, because:
1. Programmers can be snobby/elitist.  Sort of like "grammer nazi" but for being *technically correct* about programmy things.
2. It would be hard to understand what is being spoken about at a high level when examples of these genres are shown.  It helps to start with a few definitions and explanations first.
